It is a great starter garden, but if you are looking to replace your aero garden and are use to that level of interaction, this is not the machine for you. While this hydro-garden does grow plants, it is very basic with only two grow modes and no interactive system to let you know your garden status. For the price, however, it is an excellent starter garden for a kid or a purchase for someone that isnâ€™t quite ready to commit a lot of money to a name-brand top of the line hydro-garden. Like other people, I also had a problem with mold. Increasing the air flow with a fan and wiping it from the grow pods, helped a lot but did not totally solve the issue.\",\"reviewUrl\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37D68T9EOX8K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewpnt?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08TVXQ5S1#R37D68T9EOX8K4\",\"total_found_helpful\":null,\"images\":[],\"variation\":{},\"videoUrl\":null},\"reviews\":[{\"stars\":5,\"date\":\"Reviewed in the United States ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ on March 23, 2023\",\"verified_purchase\":true,\"manufacturer_replied\":false,\"username\":\"WishGigglesWishGiggles\",\"userUrl\":\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHSH5TTSNEVKK22TJA7EFFQGHIWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8\",\"title\":\"growing well\",\"review\":\"it was a little slow starting, but then got going well.

I missed planting so I contacted Qyo and since it was still under warranty, they are sending me a new one! I'm so happy. I don't normally bother with customer service/warranty work because it's too complicated and I get pissed. JENNIE at customer service was so helpful, didn't make me feel guilty for asking for the warranty coverage.
