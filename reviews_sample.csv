The light seems better than the other grow lights I have in my garden room, enough, so I'm able to put some other plants in front of the hydroponic thing to gather up some of the light. I didn't have to do the milar curtain, but I decided to try it this last month, I don't know if it makes a difference or not, it sure isn't hurting it very giftable. I'm very happy with it over all.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29SS237COCS3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08TVXQ5S1,,['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7155inkmOpL.jpg'],{'Color': 'Black'},

It was easy to setup following the instructions. I rotated seedlings all spring/summer. I'd start my seeds in hydroponics and than transfer them to their own pot to continue growing and than out to the garden!Unfortunately it stopped working and I put it away. I missed planting so I contacted Qyo and since it was still under warranty, they are sending me a new one! I'm so happy. I don't normally bother with customer service/warranty work because it's too complicated and I get pissed. JENNIE at customer service was so helpful, didn't make me feel guilty for asking for the warranty coverage. She was so helpful.I really suggest purchasing this product over others such as the Aero garden. This product has more planting room for 1/3rd the cost.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY44OLI78VFTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08TVXQ5S1,29.0,[],{'Color': 'Black'},
