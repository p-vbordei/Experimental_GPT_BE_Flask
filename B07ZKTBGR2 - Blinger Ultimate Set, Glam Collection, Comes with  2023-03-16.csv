We tried to remove but child was nervous about us touching his ear. Went to ER same night and they pushed it deeper. Went to ENT and he could not get it out. At this point close to our child’s ear drum. We ended up having to sedate a young child as advised by specialist to remove. Terrible time to have to go to the hospital during high cases of COVID. Then, we had to wait bc of limited availability. So this stone was stuck in his ear for a few days causing bleeding and pain. I don’t advise unless this is for a teenager and no small kids around.",1,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WJSHSJ4ET3LY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZKTBGR2","-","-"

With a fancy thing to stamp it on but really you could just peel it off with your finger and stick it anywhere’s adhesive doesn’t last long so these don’t stick to clothes/fabric/shoes etc very long. It lasts a day and the. You have them all over your house 😭. My daughter enjoyed it though but after she used all the stickies in a couple days , it’s pretty much useless now. The refills just aren’t worth it",3,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DEWP2EE48ZAB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZKTBGR2","-","-"

I got it for a themed day and it was so simple to set up and use. The gems are sticky which I thought was much less damaging to my hair than if they were staples and they stayed in for over 8 hours until I removed them. They were so cute and because they are sticky you can put them other places like on my face in the photo! loved these",5,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71cBsnuahFL.jpg","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KZY8TG7BUVZB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZKTBGR2","-","-"
"Reviewed in the United States on December 29, 2020","Majen","yes","yes","Girls love easy to use Blinger!","The media could not be loaded.                  The Blinger was a gift for my daughter.  The first time I had seen one of these, a friend of hers had brought one to school and she came home with gems on her with a stickiness that seemed to last and last after she had taken it off and stuck it on her forehead, nose and hair.  She then asked for one and my thought was why not if the stones stick that well and for that long even after resticking them.  The Blinger is very easy to use and came with a good amount of gems.  Keep in mind if you walk away from your child without a quick chat first, they can stick them to everything pretty fast and be out of them and ready to ask for more real quick.  My only complaint so far is opening the Blinger to put the disks in.  The instructions say to just pretty much pull it apart. It seems like it’s going to break doing that so, as you can see in the video, I hook my nails in the clear plastic to pull it apart.  It’s awkward but it feels less like I’m going to break the Blinger.  Overall I think it was a good buy and a good gift for my daughter.  She enjoys adding Bling to her hair, shoes, hats, and backpack.  We liked it so much we purchased one for my niece as well!",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R333RE6I8JYNNY/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZKTBGR2","-","-"

"Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2020","Echobeauty","yes","yes","Full of pizzazz!!!","Perfect starter kit for any youngster who has a love for pizzazz. Purchased as a gift for a bedazzling 12-year old. Jewels stick very well to practically anything (hair, fabrics, books, etc) and we haven't encountered any problems. The jewels are easily removed from hair by simply combing it out. Instead of throwing out the jewels though, suggest reusing them on books, phone cases and almost anything they want to add sparkle to. They'll go thru the jewel packs like crazy so I highly recommend buying additional jewel packs.NOTE TO PARENTS :: If you don't want it bedazzled, HIDE IT! My niece took to my wallet & fully bedazzled it. It looked like the football from the movie ""The Game Plan."" Wish I took a picture before plucking off the jewels. All in all, it's a great kit that'll make an even better gift.",5,"-","-","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LP465YMDLMER/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07ZKTBGR2","-","-"

"Reviewed in Canada on July 15, 2022","AG","yes","-","Easy use and last for days","My daughter has had the gems in for multiple days in a row, lasting through swimming in our pool and a day at the lake. She put some on our dog and 3 days later they’re still on.  They’re easy to take out without pulling the hair and can sometimes be re-used. Very easy for 6 year old to use.  Will be buying more for birthday gifts for her friends.",5,"-","-","-","-","-"

"Reviewed in Australia on June 26, 2022","SoGeo","yes","-","Huge hit with kids and adults","Everyone except the dog loved this (he doesn’t like the clicking noise) - extremely easy to use and lots of fun. The stickers have great staying power and look very cute. The 8 year old birthday girl, her friends and even the adults had so much fun bejewelling our hair and sparkling all night. It works perfectly.",5,"-","-","-","-","-"

"Reviewed in Australia on September 10, 2022","RhiRhiRhiRhi","yes","-","Product is not as advertised.","This is a hugely misleading product in the advertised pictures above. What I received was a tiny box with the jewel machine and 8 jewel discs (120 jewels in total). This is no where the advertised picture of a much larger box and 225 jewels. Even the second product option (which is more expensive) advertises 150 jewels so you can't even say that there was a product mix up as what I have received doesn't match either advertised. Extremely poor advertising and marketing on the seller's behalf, very unhappy with this purchase.",1,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71smjwc3uNL.jpg","-","-","-","-"
