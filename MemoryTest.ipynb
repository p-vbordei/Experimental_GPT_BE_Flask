       "'Stuck to 45 year olds inside of ear We tried to remove but child was nervous about us touching his ear Went to ER same night and they pushed it deeper Went to ENT and he could not get it out At this point close to our childs ear drum We ended up having to sedate a young child as advised by specialist to remove Terrible time to have to go to the hospital during high cases of COVID Then we had to wait bc of limited availability So this stone was stuck in his ear for a few days causing bleeding and pain I dont advise unless this is for a teenager and no small kids around\\n\\nMy daughter requested this for her birthday Honestly its just sparkly 3D stickers With a fancy thing to stamp it on but really you could just peel it off with your finger and stick it anywheres adhesive doesnt last long so these dont stick to clothesfabricshoes etc very long It lasts a day and the You have them all over your house  My daughter enjoyed it though but after she used all the stickies in a couple days  its pretty much useless now The refills just arent worth it\\n\\nI am obsessed with this product I got it for a themed day and it was so simple to set up and use The gems are sticky which I thought was much less damaging to my hair than if they were staples and they stayed in for over 8 hours until I removed them They were so cute and because they are sticky you can put them other places like on my face in the photo loved these\\n\\nThe media could not be loaded                 \\xa0The Blinger was a gift for my daughter  The first time I had seen one of these a friend of hers had brought one to school and she came home with gems on her with a stickiness that seemed to last and last after she had taken it off and stuck it on her forehead nose and hair  She then asked for one and my thought was why not if the stones stick that well and for that long even after resticking them  The Blinger is very easy to use and came with a good amount of gems  Keep in mind if you walk away from your child without a quick chat first they can stick them to everything pretty fast and be out of them and ready to ask for more real quick  My only complaint so far is opening the Blinger to put the disks in  The instructions say to just pretty much pull it apart It seems like its going to break doing that so as you can see in the video I hook my nails in the clear plastic to pull it apart  Its awkward but it feels less like Im going to break the Blinger  Overall I think it was a good buy and a good gift for my daughter  She enjoys adding Bling to her hair shoes hats and backpack  We liked it so much we purchased one for my niece as well\\n\\nMy four year old seen this on some YouTube video and asked me for it everyday for a week I got it for her and put it in her Easter basket It works great on thinner surfaces where you can put the fabric though and snap it But honestly my daughter was over it pretty quick and just took off the little studs and did it by hand We did our hair her camera and even her backpack Fun and a bedazzle flashback from my time Lol\\n\\nPerfect starter kit for any youngster who has a love for pizzazz Purchased as a gift for a bedazzling 12year old Jewels stick very well to practically anything hair fabrics books etc and we havent encountered any problems The jewels are easily removed from hair by simply combing it out Instead of throwing out the jewels though suggest reusing them on books phone cases and almost anything they want to add sparkle to Theyll go thru the jewel packs like crazy so I highly recommend buying additional jewel packsNOTE TO PARENTS  If you dont want it bedazzled HIDE IT My niece took to my wallet  fully bedazzled it It looked like the football from the movie The Game Plan Wish I took a picture before plucking off the jewels All in all its a great kit thatll make an even better gift\\n\\nI know some reviewers said this product is cheap but manmy niece loved it She thought it was so cool which makes me look cool Im happy 5 stars\\n\\nThese hair gems are my new favorite thing The gems are easy to take off but at the same time stay on incredibly well I had them on my hair the entire weekend and I dont think a single one fell off So fun and received compliments everywhere I went\\n\\nShipping took much longer than expected and then I received a knockoff instead of what was pictured and reviewed I decided to keep it anyway but I havent used it yet to see if its a comparable product Its just not what I was expecting Definitely does not have 225 gems as described either\\n\\nEasy to use\\n\\nI love it but I will say Im a bit disappointed that it only came in with 150 gems and not 225 gems like the description states\\n\\nlittle gemsdo not work in product Half of gems in pack are little  Wish it worked or all gems were large kind because 80percent of the large ones work\\n\\nSo cute def have to buy another one for my daughter Bought it to heal my inner child plus the uses are unlimited I use it for my hair and body and random objects I do advise parental supervision they are super sticky crystals that will stick to anything so deff talk to kids about where they are allowed to stick the crystals on\\n\\nTiktok made me buy it Its just stickers nothing special but fun\\n\\nI bought this for my daughter for Christmas  she loves it It can be used on more than just hair Its really easy to use or you can take the gems off by hand and stick them on yourself Of course the area has to be clean and hair needs to be dry My daughter plays hard at school to the point of her hair is a bit messy when she gets home from a full day at school The gems are still right where we put them in her hair before she got on the bus They come out nice and easy too I was worried about pulling but there was no pulling\\n\\nChanging names not posting my reviews should of gave me my money back\\n\\nMy 7yo Granddaughter wanted More beads that is found in local store Kept her occupied for a day and were all used Beads stay on\\n\\nThe media could not be loaded                 \\xa0Not me being an Amazon reviewer ok this product is adorable Bought it for a rave obviously Gems stayed in my hair my entire sweaty day love love love dont try to rip it apart when loading gems in theres a little lip that will open the section to place the gems Just apply small pressure if u know u know hahaha\\n\\nI am 32 years old and bought this for the 7 year old I use to be Lol I wanted one so bad in the early 90s now I have one Favorite purchase ever even if it is WAAAAY over priced for what it is lol \\n\\nVery fun gift for our 6 year old granddaughter After showing her how to use she was off blinging all kinds of items\\n\\nI love this I am 21 years old and I use this for myself for nights out or celebrations This could be used for kids and adults There are lots of gems included and I have yet to run out I bought this product awhile ago and it still works just fine Very giftable for children as well Hope this helps \\n\\nMy daughter loves this set so do I  it was a great buy everything works great its a winner \\n\\nIt got all over the furniture  Sticks to anything floor beddings  couches  Dont recommend\\n\\nRhinestones stick but had to manually put them on with tweezers Device does not work as it wont dispense the rhinestones Bought as a birthday gift and was very disappointed Also I didnt realize this item was not eligible for return\\n\\nDid not work in any sense Old sticker glue faulty machine Skip this\\n\\nThis doesnt work great\\n\\nWish I could return this It did not stick in my hair and came off throughout the night\\n\\nI saw this on tik tok actually and I knew I just had to buy it to make my hairstyle pop out more It was easy to use It comes with different shapes and colors and sizes for the gems It stayed on for the whole concert  Must buy for any occasion\\n\\nThese were a gift but my niece loves them and is going to be using them more now that she is getting older and wants to accessorize her outfits They are easy to use and a great gift for a growing girl\\n\\nEasy to use love this product my 5 year old puts this in herself 1010 recommend\\n\\nIts better to just buy sicky gems this is hard to use and its weird\\n\\nwas a bit confused initially on how to use the product but once i figured it out i loved it super in trend right now and the gems stay on my thick hair\\n\\nGreat birthday gift for my granddaughter Bought the Blinger for her 9th birthday and she loves it It really works and the little rhinestones stay attached to the hair perfectly They are easily removed to whenever youre ready to take them out Its a great gift for young girls\\n\\nthis product was so easy to use and i got so many compliments i was even able to sleep in the gems \\n\\nGot this for my 14 year old after seeing it on tic tok and she loved it Works good and gems stay on Such a cute gift for girls and cute addition to whole outfit look\\n\\nEveryone always compliments my hair with these on Im getting them for all my friends and my nieces Cute gift and fun to do with your gfs\\n\\nI Love It  Can make any basic and simple hair style pop Perfect for Big Events like Weddings n Quinceneras\\n\\nThese were purchased as a requested Christmas gift for one of our granddaughters They are cute  fun but they fell off skin  hair fairly easily fell into the carpet  were not able to be reused because they wouldnt stick well a second time I didnt feel like it was a very durable product  not really worth the cost\\n\\nMy granddaughter loves it and its so easy for her to use however I wish it would have come with better instructions instead we had to YouTube how to use it and how to use it in different ways also it could be better if you could at least reuse the gems a few time before you have to purchase more for the machine other than that it was packed well and came with a lot of gems We were very satisfied and I will be purchasing the accessories for Xmas for her I highly recommend great gift for birthdays or Xmas \\n\\nThe media could not be loaded                 \\xa0Easy to use and is perfect for my nine year old She loves the gems and the color She even bought this with her own money and wrote this review \\n\\nA mi nia le encanto lo vimos en la tienda pero este set incluye mucho mas que los de la tienda casi por el mismo precio y es facil de usar ella los usa como aretes\\n\\nQuality is cheap plastic  the gems can be purchased at the dollar store if youre willing to refill the disc manually Overall a good cheap gift for tween between the ages of 810\\n\\nThing doesnt work at all Messed up immediately Want my money back but by the time I used it for the first time it was too late to return it Total waste of money\\n\\nMy daughter has been wanting this I liked it when I saw the package reasonable price\\n\\nThis was a total waste of money It worked the first I used it then the stickers stopped coming out of the stamper onto the hair Now I have all of these sticker gems and am out 30 Do not recommend\\n\\nPicture shown is Blinger but received the imitation A life lesson in false advertising for my 9 year old daughter The product is fine otherwise\\n\\nArrived in bad condition looks like it was opened and missing pieces some of the gems were all over the plastic cover\\n\\nDo you love when your child puts stickers all over everything in your house if you answered yes then this product is for you Its pretty easy to use but its basically just stickers on a wheel and I dont even feel like you need the actual gadget to stick them oneverything\\n\\nFast shippingThought the blings would be a bit strongerTo easy to removedont stay on face Mask  very well\\n\\nThis product is a piece of junk It broke the first time my 5 year old granddaughter used it Also what a ripoff the hair bling is literally tiny stickers\\n\\nBox came really beat up This was a gift do very disappointed\\n\\nIf it ever showed up I payed for a super cute hair product that never arrived\\n\\nNo dura mucho en el pelo\\n\\nnot just for kids I saw this on tik tok and regret nothing buying it Super cute for festivals or any concert\\n\\nMe encanto sper fcil de usar y los stickers te duran mucho no se caenMe los puse para un festival de msica y me aguantaron perfectos todos en el cabello tal cual los puse hasta que llegue a casa y me los quite yo\\n\\nGood\\n\\nThe product received looks NOTHING like the picture Arrived damaged Total waste of money thats what I get for not checking the 1 star reviews first I guess\\n\\nBought for a gift\\n\\nUsed for my daughters first day of school for an extra pop to add to her hair She told me lots of kids teachers and yard duties loved her hair The gems stayed all day and came with a variety Simple cute not damaging to hair\\n\\nAll our neighbor kids love this Our daughter took 2 showers and they still stayed in Very easy to remove by picking off or brushing them out  Would buy over and over again\\n\\nThe product is okay My granddaughter wanted this so I ordered it for her as a surprise She is 5 She did love it and was happy with it Im can be a little hard to use and get the gems to stick She lost interest in it because of that I think She just took the gems off the disc and stuck them to things It was worth the smile on her face when she received it That is what matters to me\\n\\nDidnt stick very long in anyones hair\\n\\nI took me back to being a kid in the 90s The jewels dont stay in your hair they get stuck everywhere and the ones that do stay in your hair will rip it out because you had forgotten say were in there Great for festivals and concerts But this is a kids toy and it shows\\n\\nI get complements on these every time I wear them to festivals or concerts They dont fall off easily but come out when you want them to\\n\\nI love it so much I cant believe its so amazing\\n\\nMine didnt work at all \\n\\nIm in my 20s and bought these for my friends and I for a music festival So much fun\\n\\nIt was purchased for my 6 year old Granddaughter She loves it A fun gift \\n\\nThis is a great birthday present My granddaughter loved it and they look really cute in her hair\\n\\nabsolutely worth it live your sparkle hair dreams'"

make any basic and simple hair style pop Perfect for Big Events like Weddings n Quinceneras\\n\\nThese were purchased as a requested Christmas gift for one of our granddaughters They are cute  fun but they fell off skin  hair fairly easily fell into the carpet  were not able to be reused because they wouldnt stick well a second time I didnt feel like it was a very durable product  not really worth the cost\\n\\nMy granddaughter loves it and its so easy for her to use however I wish it would have come with better instructions instead we had to YouTube how to use it and how to use it in different ways also it could be better if you could at least reuse the gems a few time before you have to purchase more for the machine other than that it was packed well and came with a lot of gems We were very satisfied and I will be purchasing the accessories for Xmas for her I highly recommend great gift for birthdays or Xmas \\n\\nThe media could not be loaded                 \\xa0Easy to use and is perfect for my nine year old She loves the gems and the color She even bought this with her own money and wrote this review \\n\\nA mi nia le encanto lo vimos en la tienda pero este set incluye mucho mas que los de la tienda casi por el mismo precio y es facil de usar ella los usa como aretes\\n\\nQuality is cheap plastic  the gems can be purchased at the dollar store if youre willing to refill the disc manually Overall a good cheap gift for tween between the ages of 810\\n\\nThing doesnt work at all Messed up immediately Want my money back but by the time I used it for the first time it was too late to return it Total waste of money\\n\\nMy daughter has been wanting this I liked it when I saw the package reasonable price\\n\\nThis was a total waste of money It worked the first I used it then the stickers stopped coming out of the stamper onto the hair Now I have all of these sticker gems and am out 30 Do not recommend\\n\\nPicture shown is Blinger but received the imitation A life lesson in false advertising for my 9 year old daughter The product is fine otherwise\\n\\nArrived in bad condition looks like it was opened and missing pieces some of the gems were all over the plastic cover\\n\\nDo you love when your child puts stickers all over everything in your house if you answered yes then this product is for you Its pretty easy to use but its basically just stickers on a wheel and I dont even feel like you need the actual gadget to stick them oneverything\\n\\nFast shippingThought the blings would be a bit strongerTo easy to removedont stay on face Mask  very well\\n\\nThis product is a piece of junk It broke the first time my 5 year old granddaughter used it Also what a ripoff the hair bling is literally tiny stickers\\n\\nBox came really beat up This was a gift do very disappointed\\n\\nIf it ever showed up I payed for a super cute hair product that never arrived\\n\\nNo dura mucho en el pelo\\n\\nnot just for kids I saw this on tik tok and regret nothing buying it Super cute for festivals or any concert\\n\\nMe encanto sper fcil de usar y los stickers te duran mucho no se caenMe los puse para un festival de msica y me aguantaron perfectos todos en el cabello tal cual los puse hasta que llegue a casa y me los quite yo\\n\\nGood\\n\\nThe product received looks NOTHING like the picture Arrived damaged Total waste of money thats what I get for not checking the 1 star reviews first I guess\\n\\nBought for a gift\\n\\nUsed for my daughters first day of school for an extra pop to add to her hair She told me lots of kids teachers and yard duties loved her hair The gems stayed all day and came with a variety Simple cute not damaging to hair\\n\\nAll our neighbor kids love this Our daughter took 2 showers and they still stayed in Very easy to remove by picking off or brushing them out  Would buy over and over again\\n\\nThe product is okay My granddaughter wanted this so I ordered it for her as a surprise She is 5 She did love it and was happy with it Im can be a little hard to use and get the gems to stick She lost interest in it because of that I think She just took the gems off the disc and stuck them to things It was worth the smile on her face when she received it That is what matters to me\\n\\nDidnt stick very long in anyones hair\\n\\nI took me back to being a kid in the 90s The jewels dont stay in your hair they get stuck everywhere and the ones that do stay in your hair will rip it out because you had forgotten say were in there Great for festivals and concerts But this is a kids toy and it shows\\n\\nI get complements on these every time I wear them to festivals or concerts They dont fall off easily but come out when you want them to\\n\\nI love it so much I cant believe its so amazing\\n\\nMine didnt work at all \\n\\nIm in my 20s and bought these for my friends and I for a music festival So much fun\\n\\nIt was purchased for my 6 year old Granddaughter She loves it A fun gift \\n\\nThis is a great birthday present My granddaughter loved it and they look really cute in her hair\\n\\nabsolutely worth it live your sparkle hair dreams'"

bought this product for myself I put it on my wallet I also put it on a headband Also it looks cute added to you just your running shoes\\n\\nThis is a hugely misleading product in the advertised pictures above What I received was a tiny box with the jewel machine and 8 jewel discs 120 jewels in total This is no where the advertised picture of a much larger box and 225 jewels Even the second product option which is more expensive advertises 150 jewels so you cant even say that there was a product mix up as what I have received doesnt match either advertised Extremely poor advertising and marketing on the sellers behalf very unhappy with this purchase\\n\\nEasy and fun\\n\\nThe item was not as featured and does not contain the same number of gems The box does not feature the Blinger name brand\\n\\nItem is the size of a card and damaged I bought this as a present but now cant use Terrible marketing Very misleading\\n\\nPsimo  Es lo mismo que s los pegaras con la mano A veces se quedan pegadas en la maquinita y no en el pelo La compra ms innecesaria\\n\\nCmo juguete est bien para una nias pequea\\n\\nFacil de usar y a mi hija le encanto']"

       "['Stuck to 45 year olds inside of ear We tried to remove but child was nervous about us touching his ear Went to ER same night and they pushed it deeper Went to ENT and he could not get it out At this point close to our childs ear drum We ended up having to sedate a young child as advised by specialist to remove Terrible time to have to go to the hospital during high cases of COVID Then we had to wait bc of limited availability So this stone was stuck in his ear for a few days causing bleeding and pain I dont advise unless this is for a teenager and no small kids around\\n\\nMy daughter requested this for her birthday Honestly its just sparkly 3D stickers With a fancy thing to stamp it on but really you could just peel it off with your finger and stick it anywheres adhesive doesnt last long so these dont stick to clothesfabricshoes etc very long It lasts a day and the You have them all over your house  My daughter enjoyed it though but after she used all the stickies in a couple days  its pretty much useless now The refills just arent worth it\\n\\nI am obsessed with this product I got it for a themed day and it was so simple to set up and use The gems are sticky which I thought was much less damaging to my hair than if they were staples and they stayed in for over 8 hours until I removed them They were so cute and because they are sticky you can put them other places like on my face in the photo loved these\\n\\nThe media could not be loaded                 \\xa0The Blinger was a gift for my daughter  The first time I had seen one of these a friend of hers had brought one to school and she came home with gems on her with a stickiness that seemed to last and last after she had taken it off and stuck it on her forehead nose and hair  She then asked for one and my thought was why not if the stones stick that well and for that long even after resticking them  The Blinger is very easy to use and came with a good amount of gems  Keep in mind if you walk away from your child without a quick chat first they can stick them to everything pretty fast and be out of them and ready to ask for more real quick  My only complaint so far is opening the Blinger to put the disks in  The instructions say to just pretty much pull it apart It seems like its going to break doing that so as you can see in the video I hook my nails in the clear plastic to pull it apart  Its awkward but it feels less like Im going to break the Blinger  Overall I think it was a good buy and a good gift for my daughter  She enjoys adding Bling to her hair shoes hats and backpack  We liked it so much we purchased one for my niece as well\\n\\nMy four year old seen this on some YouTube video and asked me for it everyday for a week I got it for her and put it in her Easter basket It works great on thinner surfaces where you can put the fabric though and snap it But honestly my daughter was over it pretty quick and just took off the little studs and did it by hand We did our hair her camera and even her backpack Fun and a bedazzle flashback from my time Lol\\n\\nPerfect starter kit for any youngster who has a love for pizzazz Purchased as a gift for a bedazzling 12year old Jewels stick very well to practically anything hair fabrics books etc and we havent encountered any problems The jewels are easily removed from hair by simply combing it out Instead of throwing out the jewels though suggest reusing them on books phone cases and almost anything they want to add sparkle to Theyll go thru the jewel packs like crazy so I highly recommend buying additional jewel packsNOTE TO PARENTS  If you dont want it bedazzled HIDE IT My niece took to my wallet  fully bedazzled it It looked like the football from the movie The Game Plan Wish I took a picture before plucking off the jewels All in all its a great kit thatll make an even better gift\\n\\nI know some reviewers said this product is cheap but manmy niece loved it She thought it was so cool which makes me look cool Im happy 5 stars\\n\\nThese hair gems are my new favorite thing The gems are easy to take off but at the same time stay on incredibly well I had them on my hair the entire weekend and I dont think a single one fell off So fun and received compliments everywhere I went\\n\\nShipping took much longer than expected and then I received a knockoff instead of what was pictured and reviewed I decided to keep it anyway but I havent used it yet to see if its a comparable product Its just not what I was expecting Definitely does not have 225 gems as described either\\n\\nEasy to use\\n\\nI love it but I will say Im a bit disappointed that it only came in with 150 gems and not 225 gems like the description states\\n\\nlittle gemsdo not work in product Half of gems in pack are little  Wish it worked or all gems were large kind because 80percent of the large ones work\\n\\nSo cute def have to buy another one for my daughter Bought it to heal my inner child plus the uses are unlimited I use it for my hair and body and random objects I do advise parental supervision they are super sticky crystals that will stick to anything so deff talk to kids about where they are allowed to stick the crystals on\\n\\nTiktok made me buy it Its just stickers nothing special but fun\\n\\nI bought this for my daughter for Christmas  she loves it It can be used on more than just hair Its really easy to use or you can take the gems off by hand and stick them on yourself Of course the area has to be clean and hair needs to be dry My daughter plays hard at school to the point of her hair is a bit messy when she gets home from a full day at school The gems are still right where we put them in her hair before she got on the bus They come out nice and easy too I was worried about pulling but there was no pulling\\n\\nChanging names not posting my reviews should of gave me my money back\\n\\nMy 7yo Granddaughter wanted More beads that is found in local store Kept her occupied for a day and were all used Beads stay on\\n\\nThe media could not be loaded                 \\xa0Not me being an Amazon reviewer ok this product is adorable Bought it for a rave obviously Gems stayed in my hair my entire sweaty day love love love dont try to rip it apart when loading gems in theres a little lip that will open the section to place the gems Just apply small pressure if u know u know

out or celebrations This could be used for kids and adults There are lots of gems included and I have yet to run out I bought this product awhile ago and it still works just fine Very giftable for children as well Hope this helps \\n\\nMy daughter loves this set so do I  it was a great buy everything works great its a winner \\n\\nIt got all over the furniture  Sticks to anything floor beddings  couches  Dont recommend\\n\\nRhinestones stick but had to manually put them on with tweezers Device does not work as it wont dispense the rhinestones Bought as a birthday gift and was very disappointed Also I didnt realize this item was not eligible for return\\n\\nDid not work in any sense Old sticker glue faulty machine Skip this\\n\\nThis doesnt work great\\n\\nWish I could return this It did not stick in my hair and came off throughout the night\\n\\nI saw this on tik tok actually and I knew I just had to buy it to make my hairstyle pop out more It was easy to use It comes with different shapes and colors and sizes for the gems It stayed on for the whole concert  Must buy for any occasion\\n\\nThese were a gift but my niece loves them and is going to be using them more now that she is getting older and wants to accessorize her outfits They are easy to use and a great gift for a growing girl\\n\\nEasy to use love this product my 5 year old puts this in herself 1010 recommend\\n\\nIts better to just buy sicky gems this is hard to use and its weird\\n\\nwas a bit confused initially on how to use the product but once i figured it out i loved it super in trend right now and the gems stay on my thick hair\\n\\nGreat birthday gift for my granddaughter Bought the Blinger for her 9th birthday and she loves it It really works and the little rhinestones stay attached to the hair perfectly They are easily removed to whenever youre ready to take them out Its a great gift for young girls\\n\\nthis product was so easy to use and i got so many compliments i was even able to sleep in the gems \\n\\nGot this for my 14 year old after seeing it on tic tok and she loved it Works good and gems stay on Such a cute gift for girls and cute addition to whole outfit look\\n\\nEveryone always compliments my hair with these on Im getting them for all my friends and my nieces Cute gift and fun to do with your gfs\\n\\nI Love It  Can make any basic and simple hair style pop Perfect for Big Events like Weddings n Quinceneras\\n\\nThese were purchased as a requested Christmas gift for one of our granddaughters They are cute  fun but they fell off skin  hair fairly easily fell into the carpet  were not able to be reused because they wouldnt stick well a second time I didnt feel like it was a very durable product  not really worth the cost\\n\\nMy granddaughter loves it and its so easy for her to use however I wish it would have come with better instructions instead we had to YouTube how to use it and how to use it in different ways also it could be better if you could at least reuse the gems a few time before you have to purchase more for the machine other than that it was packed well and came with a lot of gems We were very satisfied and I will be purchasing the accessories for Xmas for her I highly recommend great gift for birthdays or Xmas \\n\\nThe media could not be loaded                 \\xa0Easy to use and is perfect for my nine year old She loves the gems and the color She even bought this with her own money and wrote this review \\n\\nA mi nia le encanto lo vimos en la tienda pero este set incluye mucho mas que los de la tienda casi por el mismo precio y es facil de usar ella los usa como aretes\\n\\nQuality is cheap plastic  the gems can be purchased at the dollar store if youre willing to refill the disc manually Overall a good cheap gift for tween between the ages of 810\\n\\nThing doesnt work at all Messed up immediately Want my money back but by the time I used it for the first time it was too late to return it Total waste of money\\n\\nMy daughter has been wanting this I liked it when I saw the package reasonable price\\n\\nThis was a total waste of money It worked the first I used it then the stickers stopped coming out of the stamper onto the hair Now I have all of these sticker gems and am out 30 Do not recommend\\n\\nPicture shown is Blinger but received the imitation A life lesson in false advertising for my 9 year old daughter The product is fine otherwise\\n\\nArrived in bad condition looks like it was opened and missing pieces some of the gems were all over the plastic cover\\n\\nDo you love when your child puts stickers all over everything in your house if you answered yes then this product is for you Its pretty easy to use but its basically just stickers on a wheel and I dont even feel like you need the actual gadget to stick them oneverything\\n\\nFast shippingThought the blings would be a bit strongerTo easy to removedont stay on face Mask  very well\\n\\nThis product is a piece of junk It broke the first time my 5 year old granddaughter used it Also what a ripoff the hair bling is literally tiny stickers\\n\\nBox came really beat up This was a gift do very disappointed\\n\\nIf it ever showed up I payed for a super cute hair product that never arrived\\n\\nNo dura mucho en el pelo\\n\\nnot just for kids I saw this on tik tok and regret nothing buying it Super cute for festivals or any concert\\n\\nMe encanto sper fcil de usar y los stickers te duran mucho no se caenMe los puse para un festival de msica y me aguantaron perfectos todos en el cabello tal cual los puse hasta que llegue a casa y me los quite yo\\n\\nGood\\n\\nThe product received looks NOTHING like the picture Arrived damaged Total waste of money thats what I get for not checking the 1 star reviews first I guess\\n\\nBought for a gift\\n\\nUsed for my daughters first day of school for an extra pop to add to her hair She told me lots of kids teachers and yard duties loved her hair The gems stayed all day and came with a variety Simple cute not damaging to hair\\n\\nAll our neighbor kids love this Our daughter took 2 showers and they still stayed in Very easy to remove by picking off or brushing them out  Would buy over and over again\\n\\nThe product is okay My granddaughter wanted this so I ordered it for her as a surprise She is 5 She did love it and was happy with it Im can be a little hard to use and get the gems to stick She lost interest in it because of that I think She just took the gems off the disc and stuck them to things It was worth the smile on her face when she received it That is what matters to me\\n\\nDidnt stick very long in anyones hair\\n\\nI took me back to being a kid in the 90s The jewels dont stay in your hair they get stuck everywhere and the ones that do stay in your hair will rip it out because you had forgotten say were in there Great for festivals and concerts But this is a kids toy and it shows\\n\\nI get complements on these every time I wear them to festivals or concerts They dont fall off easily but come out when you want them to\\n\\nI love it so much I cant believe its so amazing\\n\\nMine didnt work at all \\n\\nIm in my 20s and bought these for my friends and I for a music festival So much fun\\n\\nIt was purchased for my 6 year old Granddaughter She loves it A fun gift \\n\\nThis is a great birthday present My granddaughter loved it and they look really cute in her hair\\n\\nabsolutely worth it live your sparkle hair dreams']"
