I put in the max amount of water at first and the pump just didn't really work. When it evaporated down to around 2L I could really see it working when the timer turned it on. I started a few herbs from plants I washed the dirt out of, but only the Basil did well with that method. The plants I eventually started from seed did better.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KR8RQQCDK9QZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08TVXQ5S1,,[],{'Color': 'Black'},

It has great instructions located in the manual for a easy set up and the User Guide can be placed for continued reference. The possibilities are endless for this model. Inside growth of veg or flowers as well as a alternative for starting seedlings to plant outdoors as weather permits. I can grow all through winter and harvest almost daily and outside changes will not affect me. The pods to grow as well as the clear capsules are included. All I had to do was set up in five minutes, add my seeds and start journaling on this gardening journey. I have recommended this to others in my gardening group and I see myself returning in the near future to purchase another unit so I can really have grand harvest right here in my apartment.

It was easy to setup following the instructions. I rotated seedlings all spring/summer. I'd start my seeds in hydroponics and than transfer them to their own pot to continue growing and than out to the garden!Unfortunately it stopped working and I put it away. I missed planting so I contacted Qyo and since it was still under warranty, they are sending me a new one! I'm so happy. I don't normally bother with customer service/warranty work because it's too complicated and I get pissed. JENNIE at customer service was so helpful, didn't make me feel guilty for asking for the warranty coverage. She was so helpful.I really suggest purchasing this product over others such as the Aero garden. This product has more planting room for 1/3rd the cost.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY44OLI78VFTW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08TVXQ5S1,32.0,[],{'Color': 'Black'},

The light seems better than the other grow lights I have in my garden room, enough, so I'm able to put some other plants in front of the hydroponic thing to gather up some of the light.

It is a great starter garden, but if you are looking to replace your aero garden and are use to that level of interaction, this is not the machine for you. While this hydro-garden does grow plants, it is very basic with only two grow modes and no interactive system to let you know your garden status. For the price, however, it is an excellent starter garden for a kid or a purchase for someone that isnâ€™t quite ready to commit a lot of money to a name-brand top of the line hydro-garden. Like other people, I also had a problem with mold. Increasing the air flow with a fan and wiping it from the grow pods, helped a lot but did not totally solve the issue.",https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R37D68T9EOX8K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08TVXQ5S1,1.0,[],{'Color': 'Black'},
