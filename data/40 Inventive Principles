The 40 Inventive Principles


To provide enough context for a large language model (LLM) to apply the 40 Inventive Principles, the prompt document should give an overview of the TRIZ methodology, the problem at hand, and a brief description of each of the 40 principles. Below is an LLM prompt document, which is approximately 2000 tokens long:

TRIZ and the 40 Inventive Principles
TRIZ is a problem-solving methodology developed by Genrich Altshuller, a Russian inventor and engineer. It is based on the analysis of patents and aims to identify and resolve contradictions in the design and development of new products and systems. One of the core elements of TRIZ is the 40 Inventive Principles, which serve as a set of guidelines for generating innovative ideas and solving problems.

The 40 Inventive Principles are grouped into five categories:
1. Improving the System
2. Eliminating or Reducing Harmful Effects
3. Enhancing Useful Effects
4. Detecting and Measuring Effects
5. System Transition and Evolution


The goal is to apply these principles to identify innovative solutions to the problem at hand, which revolves around [PROBLEM STATEMENT]. Below is a brief description of each principle, followed by examples of how they could be applied to the problem:
