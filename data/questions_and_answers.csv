"Stuck to 45 year olds inside of ear We tried to remove but child was nervous about us touching his ear Went to ER same night and they pushed it deeper Went to ENT and he could not get it out At this point close to our childs ear drum We ended up having to sedate a young child as advised by specialist to remove Terrible time to have to go to the hospital during high cases of COVID Then we had to wait bc of limited availability So this stone was stuck in his ear for a few days causing bleeding and pain I dont advise unless this is for a teenager and no small kids around

My daughter requested this for her birthday Honestly its just sparkly 3D stickers With a fancy thing to stamp it on but really you could just peel it off with your finger and stick it anywheres adhesive doesnt last long so these dont stick to clothesfabricshoes etc very long It lasts a day and the You have them all over your house  My daughter enjoyed it though but after she used all the stickies in a couple days  its pretty much useless now The refills just arent worth it

I am obsessed with this product I got it for a themed day and it was so simple to set up and use The gems are sticky which I thought was much less damaging to my hair than if they were staples and they stayed in for over 8 hours until I removed them They were so cute and because they are sticky you can put them other places like on my face in the photo loved these

The media could not be loaded                  The Blinger was a gift for my daughter  The first time I had seen one of these a friend of hers had brought one to school and she came home with gems on her with a stickiness that seemed to last and last after she had taken it off and stuck it on her forehead nose and hair  She then asked for one and my thought was why not if the stones stick that well and for that long even after resticking them  The Blinger is very easy to use and came with a good amount of gems  Keep in mind if you walk away from your child without a quick chat first they can stick them to everything pretty fast and be out of them and ready to ask for more real quick  My only complaint so far is opening the Blinger to put the disks in  The instructions say to just pretty much pull it apart It seems like its going to break doing that so as you can see in the video I hook my nails in the clear plastic to pull it apart  Its awkward but it feels less like Im going to break the Blinger  Overall I think it was a good buy and a good gift for my daughter  She enjoys adding Bling to her hair shoes hats and backpack  We liked it so much we purchased one for my niece as well

My four year old seen this on some YouTube video and asked me for it everyday for a week I got it for her and put it in her Easter basket It works great on thinner surfaces where you can put the fabric though and snap it But honestly my daughter was over it pretty quick and just took off the little studs and did it by hand We did our hair her camera and even her backpack Fun and a bedazzle flashback from my time Lol

Perfect starter kit for any youngster who has a love for pizzazz Purchased as a gift for a bedazzling 12year old Jewels stick very well to practically anything hair fabrics books etc and we havent encountered any problems The jewels are easily removed from hair by simply combing it out Instead of throwing out the jewels though suggest reusing them on books phone cases and almost anything they want to add sparkle to Theyll go thru the jewel packs like crazy so I highly recommend buying additional jewel packsNOTE TO PARENTS  If you dont want it bedazzled HIDE IT My niece took to my wallet  fully bedazzled it It looked like the football from the movie The Game Plan Wish I took a picture before plucking off the jewels All in all its a great kit thatll make an even better gift

I know some reviewers said this product is cheap but manmy niece loved it She thought it was so cool which makes me look cool Im happy 5 stars

These hair gems are my new favorite thing The gems are easy to take off but at the same time stay on incredibly well I had them on my hair the entire weekend and I dont think a single one fell off So fun and received compliments everywhere I went

Shipping took much longer than expected and then I received a knockoff instead of what was pictured and reviewed I decided to keep it anyway but I havent used it yet to see if its a comparable product Its just not what I was expecting Definitely does not have 225 gems as described either

Easy to use

I love it but I will say Im a bit disappointed that it only came in with 150 gems and not 225 gems like the description states

little gemsdo not work in product Half of gems in pack are little  Wish it worked or all gems were large kind because 80percent of the large ones work

So cute def have to buy another one for my daughter Bought it to heal my inner child plus the uses are unlimited I use it for my hair and body and random objects I do advise parental supervision they are super sticky crystals that will stick to anything so deff talk to kids about where they are allowed to stick the crystals on

Tiktok made me buy it Its just stickers nothing special but fun

I bought this for my daughter for Christmas  she loves it It can be used on more than just hair Its really easy to use or you can take the gems off by hand and stick them on yourself Of course the area has to be clean and hair needs to be dry My daughter plays hard at school to the point of her hair is a bit messy when she gets home from a full day at school The gems are still right where we put them in her hair before she got on the bus They come out nice and easy too I was worried about pulling but there was no pulling

Changing names not posting my reviews should of gave me my money back

My 7yo Granddaughter wanted More beads that is found in local store Kept her occupied for a day and were all used Beads stay on

The media could not be loaded                  Not me being an Amazon reviewer ok this product is adorable Bought it for a rave obviously Gems stayed in my hair my entire sweaty day love love love dont try to rip it apart when loading gems in theres a little lip that will open the section to place the gems Just apply small pressure if u know u know hahaha

I am 32 years old and bought this for the 7 year old I use to be Lol I wanted one so bad in the early 90s now I have one Favorite purchase ever even if it is WAAAAY over priced for what it is lol 

Very fun gift for our 6 year old granddaughter After showing her how to use she was off blinging all kinds of items

I love this I am 21 years old and I use this for myself for nights out or celebrations This could be used for kids and adults There are lots of gems included and I have yet to run out I bought this product awhile ago and it still works just fine Very giftable for children as well Hope this helps 

My daughter loves this set so do I  it was a great buy everything works great its a winner 

It got all over the furniture  Sticks to anything floor beddings  couches  Dont recommend

Rhinestones stick but had to manually put them on with tweezers Device does not work as it wont dispense the rhinestones Bought as a birthday gift and was very disappointed Also I didnt realize this item was not eligible for return

Did not work in any sense Old sticker glue faulty machine Skip this

This doesnt work great

Wish I could return this It did not stick in my hair and came off throughout the night

I saw this on tik tok actually and I knew I just had to buy it to make my hairstyle pop out more It was easy to use It comes with different shapes and colors and sizes for the gems It stayed on for the whole concert  Must buy for any occasion

These were a gift but my niece loves them and is going to be using them more now that she is getting older and wants to accessorize her outfits They are easy to use and a great gift for a growing girl

Easy to use love this product my 5 year old puts this in herself 1010 recommend

Its better to just buy sicky gems this is hard to use and its weird

was a bit confused initially on how to use the product but once i figured it out i loved it super in trend right now and the gems stay on my thick hair

Great birthday gift for my granddaughter Bought the Blinger for her 9th birthday and she loves it It really works and the little rhinestones stay attached to the hair perfectly They are easily removed to whenever youre ready to take them out Its a great gift for young girls

this product was so easy to use and i got so many compliments i was even able to sleep in the gems 

Got this for my 14 year old after seeing it on tic tok and she loved it Works good and gems stay on Such a cute gift for girls and cute addition to whole outfit look

Everyone always compliments my hair with these on Im getting them for all my friends and my nieces Cute gift and fun to do with your gfs

I Love It  Can make any basic and simple hair style pop Perfect for Big Events like Weddings n Quinceneras

These were purchased as a requested Christmas gift for one of our granddaughters They are cute  fun but they fell off skin  hair fairly easily fell into the carpet  were not able to be reused because they wouldnt stick well a second time I didnt feel like it was a very durable product  not really worth the cost

My granddaughter loves it and its so easy for her to use however I wish it would have come with better instructions instead we had to YouTube how to use it and how to use it in different ways also it could be better if you could at least reuse the gems a few time before you have to purchase more for the machine other than that it was packed well and came with a lot of gems We were very satisfied and I will be purchasing the accessories for Xmas for her I highly recommend great gift for birthdays or Xmas 

The media could not be loaded                  Easy to use and is perfect for my nine year old She loves the gems and the color She even bought this with her own money and wrote this review 

A mi nia le encanto lo vimos en la tienda pero este set incluye mucho mas que los de la tienda casi por el mismo precio y es facil de usar ella los usa como aretes

Quality is cheap plastic  the gems can be purchased at the dollar store if youre willing to refill the disc manually Overall a good cheap gift for tween between the ages of 810

Thing doesnt work at all Messed up immediately Want my money back but by the time I used it for the first time it was too late to return it Total waste of money

My daughter has been wanting this I liked it when I saw the package reasonable price

This was a total waste of money It worked the first I used it then the stickers stopped coming out of the stamper onto the hair Now I have all of these sticker gems and am out 30 Do not recommend

Picture shown is Blinger but received the imitation A life lesson in false advertising for my 9 year old daughter The product is fine otherwise

Arrived in bad condition looks like it was opened and missing pieces some of the gems were all over the plastic cover

Do you love when your child puts stickers all over everything in your house if you answered yes then this product is for you Its pretty easy to use but its basically just stickers on a wheel and I dont even feel like you need the actual gadget to stick them oneverything

Fast shippingThought the blings would be a bit strongerTo easy to removedont stay on face Mask  very well

This product is a piece of junk It broke the first time my 5 year old granddaughter used it Also what a ripoff the hair bling is literally tiny stickers

Box came really beat up This was a gift do very disappointed

If it ever showed up I payed for a super cute hair product that never arrived

No dura mucho en el pelo

not just for kids I saw this on tik tok and regret nothing buying it Super cute for festivals or any concert

Me encanto sper fcil de usar y los stickers te duran mucho no se caenMe los puse para un festival de msica y me aguantaron perfectos todos en el cabello tal cual los puse hasta que llegue a casa y me los quite yo

Good

The product received looks NOTHING like the picture Arrived damaged Total waste of money thats what I get for not checking the 1 star reviews first I guess

Bought for a gift

Used for my daughters first day of school for an extra pop to add to her hair She told me lots of kids teachers and yard duties loved her hair The gems stayed all day and came with a variety Simple cute not damaging to hair

All our neighbor kids love this Our daughter took 2 showers and they still stayed in Very easy to remove by picking off or brushing them out  Would buy over and over again

The product is okay My granddaughter wanted this so I ordered it for her as a surprise She is 5 She did love it and was happy with it Im can be a little hard to use and get the gems to stick She lost interest in it because of that I think She just took the gems off the disc and stuck them to things It was worth the smile on her face when she received it That is what matters to me

Didnt stick very long in anyones hair

I took me back to being a kid in the 90s The jewels dont stay in your hair they get stuck everywhere and the ones that do stay in your hair will rip it out because you had forgotten say were in there Great for festivals and concerts But this is a kids toy and it shows

I get complements on these every time I wear them to festivals or concerts They dont fall off easily but come out when you want them to

I love it so much I cant believe its so amazing

Mine didnt work at all 

Im in my 20s and bought these for my friends and I for a music festival So much fun

It was purchased for my 6 year old Granddaughter She loves it A fun gift 

This is a great birthday present My granddaughter loved it and they look really cute in her hair

"Stuck to 45 year olds inside of ear We tried to remove but child was nervous about us touching his ear Went to ER same night and they pushed it deeper Went to ENT and he could not get it out At this point close to our childs ear drum We ended up having to sedate a young child as advised by specialist to remove Terrible time to have to go to the hospital during high cases of COVID Then we had to wait bc of limited availability So this stone was stuck in his ear for a few days causing bleeding and pain I dont advise unless this is for a teenager and no small kids around

I love this I am 21 years old and I use this for myself for nights out or celebrations This could be used for kids and adults There are lots of gems included and I have yet to run out I bought this product awhile ago and it still works just fine Very giftable for children as well Hope this helps 

My daughter loves this set so do I  it was a great buy everything works great its a winner 

It got all over the furniture  Sticks to anything floor beddings  couches  Dont recommend

Rhinestones stick but had to manually put them on with tweezers Device does not work as it wont dispense the rhinestones Bought as a birthday gift and was very disappointed Also I didnt realize this item was not eligible for return

Did not work in any sense Old sticker glue faulty machine Skip this

This doesnt work great

Wish I could return this It did not stick in my hair and came off throughout the night

I saw this on tik tok actually and I knew I just had to buy it to make my hairstyle pop out more It was easy to use It comes with different shapes and colors and sizes for the gems It stayed on for the whole concert  Must buy for any occasion

These were a gift but my niece loves them and is going to be using them more now that she is getting older and wants to accessorize her outfits They are easy to use and a great gift for a growing girl

Easy to use love this product my 5 year old puts this in herself 1010 recommend

Its better to just buy sicky gems this is hard to use and its weird

was a bit confused initially on how to use the product but once i figured it out i loved it super in trend right now and the gems stay on my thick hair

Great birthday gift for my granddaughter Bought the Blinger for her 9th birthday and she loves it It really works and the little rhinestones stay attached to the hair perfectly They are easily removed to whenever youre ready to take them out Its a great gift for young girls

this product was so easy to use and i got so many compliments i was even able to sleep in the gems 

Got this for my 14 year old after seeing it on tic tok and she loved it Works good and gems stay on Such a cute gift for girls and cute addition to whole outfit look

Everyone always compliments my hair with these on Im getting them for all my friends and my nieces Cute gift and fun to do with your gfs

I Love It  Can make any basic and simple hair style pop Perfect for Big Events like Weddings n Quinceneras

These were purchased as a requested Christmas gift for one of our granddaughters They are cute  fun but they fell off skin  hair fairly easily fell into the carpet  were not able to be reused because they wouldnt stick well a second time I didnt feel like it was a very durable product  not really worth the cost

My granddaughter loves it and its so easy for her to use however I wish it would have come with better instructions instead we had to YouTube how to use it and how to use it in different ways also it could be better if you could at least reuse the gems a few time before you have to purchase more for the machine other than that it was packed well and came with a lot of gems We were very satisfied and I will be purchasing the accessories for Xmas for her I highly recommend great gift for birthdays or Xmas 

The media could not be loaded                  Easy to use and is perfect for my nine year old She loves the gems and the color She even bought this with her own money and wrote this review 

A mi nia le encanto lo vimos en la tienda pero este set incluye mucho mas que los de la tienda casi por el mismo precio y es facil de usar ella los usa como aretes

Quality is cheap plastic  the gems can be purchased at the dollar store if youre willing to refill the disc manually Overall a good cheap gift for tween between the ages of 810

Thing doesnt work at all Messed up immediately Want my money back but by the time I used it for the first time it was too late to return it Total waste of money

My daughter has been wanting this I liked it when I saw the package reasonable price

This was a total waste of money It worked the first I used it then the stickers stopped coming out of the stamper onto the hair Now I have all of these sticker gems and am out 30 Do not recommend

Picture shown is Blinger but received the imitation A life lesson in false advertising for my 9 year old daughter The product is fine otherwise

Arrived in bad condition looks like it was opened and missing pieces some of the gems were all over the plastic cover

Do you love when your child puts stickers all over everything in your house if you answered yes then this product is for you Its pretty easy to use but its basically just stickers on a wheel and I dont even feel like you need the actual gadget to stick them oneverything

Fast shippingThought the blings would be a bit strongerTo easy to removedont stay on face Mask  very well

This product is a piece of junk It broke the first time my 5 year old granddaughter used it Also what a ripoff the hair bling is literally tiny stickers

Box came really beat up This was a gift do very disappointed

If it ever showed up I payed for a super cute hair product that never arrived

No dura mucho en el pelo

not just for kids I saw this on tik tok and regret nothing buying it Super cute for festivals or any concert

Me encanto sper fcil de usar y los stickers te duran mucho no se caenMe los puse para un festival de msica y me aguantaron perfectos todos en el cabello tal cual los puse hasta que llegue a casa y me los quite yo

Good

The product received looks NOTHING like the picture Arrived damaged Total waste of money thats what I get for not checking the 1 star reviews first I guess

Bought for a gift

Used for my daughters first day of school for an extra pop to add to her hair She told me lots of kids teachers and yard duties loved her hair The gems stayed all day and came with a variety Simple cute not damaging to hair

All our neighbor kids love this Our daughter took 2 showers and they still stayed in Very easy to remove by picking off or brushing them out  Would buy over and over again

The product is okay My granddaughter wanted this so I ordered it for her as a surprise She is 5 She did love it and was happy with it Im can be a little hard to use and get the gems to stick She lost interest in it because of that I think She just took the gems off the disc and stuck them to things It was worth the smile on her face when she received it That is what matters to me

Didnt stick very long in anyones hair

I took me back to being a kid in the 90s The jewels dont stay in your hair they get stuck everywhere and the ones that do stay in your hair will rip it out because you had forgotten say were in there Great for festivals and concerts But this is a kids toy and it shows

I get complements on these every time I wear them to festivals or concerts They dont fall off easily but come out when you want them to

I love it so much I cant believe its so amazing

Mine didnt work at all 

Im in my 20s and bought these for my friends and I for a music festival So much fun

It was purchased for my 6 year old Granddaughter She loves it A fun gift 

This is a great birthday present My granddaughter loved it and they look really cute in her hair

"Bought this for my 5 year old daughter She loves it It was very easy to use and it stayed in her hair overnight and the whole next day Easy to remove from hair

My two daughters absolutely love glitter or anything shiny so the Blinger Ultimate Set was a perfect gift for them It is very easy for them to use with younger kids and adult should help read instructions but after that they will get it

I bought this for my niece and she loves it She has the little sparkle pieces in her hair every time I see her

Disappointed in the cheap plastic set I couldve easily bought jewels and stuck them in my hair without this plastic applicator

Bought as a gift for my daughter who loves all things shiny  Shes enjoyed blinging not only her hair but also her clothes and bookshelves

Im nearly 30 and bought this for myself lol I love the bling and it really holds in the hair My only complaint would be I wish each ring came with more bling

Not very tough made and doesnt always work right

It was a fun gift for my niece she used it for a day and got bored with it because the gems fell off moments after being applied

My daughter likes this  It is so easy her dad can use it  It takes a bunch to be obvious in the hair  Easy to remove to  Why not give it a shot

Our 5 year old begged for this after seeing it on youtube She already knew how to load it The jewels are just stickers but stick well and dont fall out easy It comes with a good amount of refills too

My daughter asked for this for christmas I was happy with the packaging and product ovverall

There super cute but the product is a bit wonky and gets jammed

Great gift for a little one My niece I got it for is 5 but her older sister who is 7 also loves it

This item is so cute but I wasnt happy with how difficult is was to use the bling got constantly stuck in the machine The bling sticks on well if you can get it to work my 7 year old couldnt use it

Cute idea but the clip inside that turns the gems broke within the first few gems applied I can still use it but I have to turn the wheel with my fingers and the wheel is hard to turn Not put together well at all

This was a Christmas gift for my 7 year old granddaughter and she was so excited Shed wanted it awhile But were  so very disappointedit broke the first time Very upsetting



Hard for children to use Not worth the money

I want to give it to my nieces xmas gift and today when I try to open the package  I found a hair and the box is damaged  Its not a new one  Return it

Product falls out of hair after less than a minute Cheaply made

This item broke after 4 uses The piece into the center of the product popped off and wouldnt pop back on for operation Complete waste of money

I thought this was going to be the actual blinger turned out it was just the replacement kit

It broke the first day Wont recommend

Stickers would not stick to anything

Exactly what it says

Got this kit on Amazon Prime Day my daughter enjoyed decorating her hair with the blinger and I am very happy with the deal  Definitely will recommend this

Super fun an easy to put brings on anything  Very cool item for any girl

Bought this for my granddaughter The little sticky jewels will not stick to hair let alone much else I am disappointed in the product and regret purchasing it

This was a gift for a 9yearold family member She had a great deal of fun playing with it and glamorizing everyones hair including the menThe men were good sports but were fairly quick to remove them after a bit I even had a couple placed in my hair and it hurt a tiny bit when it was removed as I have a lot of hairbut it left no residue to clean up which is goodHer little sister may be getting that next year  if someone takes the hint lol

My 9 year old granddaughter got this for Christmas  She was delighted and had asked for it She blings anything that stands still long enough to get a sparkle  She has decorated my sweater purse and her cats collar  Im sure I will be buying refills for it soon It is easy to use and fun for her to decorate things with  They are easy to remove and relocate

I bought this for my 7 year old great granddaughter and she and her best friend love it I hear their giggles as they glam up

It is like a bedazzle like from back in time My daughter loves putting them in her hair on on clothes and really on anything that she can think of they stick in the hair the best

Worked like a charm for my grandaughters birthday gift She is having a blast using itBig smiles all around

Perfect and easy to use for a 7 and 5 year old great combo of jewels too

Its a great tool to bedazzle your hair Moms and Grandmas too

I thought this was gonna be super dumb but my daughter loves it

Eight year old Granddaughter loved it She even blinged the dog

Love this

Very easy to use The gems stayed on all night long and until the morning They are easy to take off just brush them off or pick them off

Fast shipping thanks

Gift for my niece

My daughter loves it

Got this for my daughter and she is OBSESSED Its so easy to use and so perfect for occasions

My 5yr old loves this She isnt disappointed one bit She has blinged everything including the dog

It not as easy to use as seen on camera also when my daughter finally gets it in her hair it fall out all over the house

Granddaughter loves it

Fairly easy to use and granddaughters fought over it The little pieces ended up on the floor and kept us busy cleaning them up but worth it

This item is horrible Doesnt work as described Blinker cant staple gems in to the hair

All my granddaughters loved this ages 6 8 10  The jewels stick nice but super easy to come off with no damage to surface  Super easy to use

Perfect gift for my 7 year old niece

Ive always wanted these when I was younger and now that Im older Im so happy I can buy these for myself They could also be a perfect gift for someone in your life Very easy to use and great value for the money

they love it

Me hubiera gustado que trajera ms repuestos trae muy pocos

Lo compr para mi adulta con cabello largo y grueso y creo que funciona mejor para infantes pero an as est cool

My daughter has had the gems in for multiple days in a row lasting through swimming in our pool and a day at the lake She put some on our dog and 3 days later theyre still on  Theyre easy to take out without pulling the hair and can sometimes be reused Very easy for 6 year old to use  Will be buying more for birthday gifts for her friends

Too expensive

La verdad es que es justo como lo esperaba lo us para un festival musical en el que cant grit bail y sud por horas incluso despus me amarr el cabello y los brillitos seguan en su lugar

Everyone except the dog loved this he doesnt like the clicking noise  extremely easy to use and lots of fun The stickers have great staying power and look very cute The 8 year old birthday girl her friends and even the adults had so much fun bejewelling our hair and sparkling all night It works perfectly

Esta divertido pero las piedras se caen con mucha facilidad no necesitas tocarlas para q se caigan porque caen por s solas y a pesar de q tengo prime tuve problemas con el envo x parte del vendedor aunque Amazon me resolvi rpido

No se parece nada en la publicacin se ve una caja grande y de muy buena calidadPero ya en vivo se ve muy distintoNada que ver con lo publicado

This product didnt come in a big box like shown does not have the number of gems that it says it had I now have to buy more elsewhere Not happy that it wasnt as shown

Lleg antes de lo programado y le gusto a mi hija recomiendo al vendedor

Le encant a mi hija

Excelente regalo de navidad

Its a gifted for my niece I am hoping she will love it as for she did want one really bad so I guess I will see on Christmas Day

Its cute would not pay full price for it as the gems fall out so easy

I really liked this product I am an adult and bought this product for myself I put it on my wallet I also put it on a headband Also it looks cute added to you just your running shoes

This is a hugely misleading product in the advertised pictures above What I received was a tiny box with the jewel machine and 8 jewel discs 120 jewels in total This is no where the advertised picture of a much larger box and 225 jewels Even the second product option which is more expensive advertises 150 jewels so you cant even say that there was a product mix up as what I have received doesnt match either advertised Extremely poor advertising and marketing on the sellers behalf very unhappy with this purchase

Easy and fun

The item was not as featured and does not contain the same number of gems The box does not feature the Blinger name brand

Item is the size of a card and damaged I bought this as a present but now cant use Terrible marketing Very misleading

Psimo  Es lo mismo que s los pegaras con la mano A veces se quedan pegadas en la maquinita y no en el pelo La compra ms innecesaria

Cmo juguete est bien para una nias pequea

Facil de usar y a mi hija le encanto",What are the top traits that customers appreciate the most about a product?

This is a hugely misleading product in the advertised pictures above What I received was a tiny box with the jewel machine and 8 jewel discs 120 jewels in total This is no where the advertised picture of a much larger box and 225 jewels Even the second product option which is more expensive advertises 150 jewels so you cant even say that there was a product mix up as what I have received doesnt match either advertised Extremely poor advertising and marketing on the sellers behalf very unhappy with this purchase

Easy and fun

The item was not as featured and does not contain the same number of gems The box does not feature the Blinger name brand

Item is the size of a card and damaged I bought this as a present but now cant use Terrible marketing Very misleading

Psimo  Es lo mismo que s los pegaras con la mano A veces se quedan pegadas en la maquinita y no en el pelo La compra ms innecesaria

Cmo juguete est bien para una nias pequea

"Bought this for my 5 year old daughter She loves it It was very easy to use and it stayed in her hair overnight and the whole next day Easy to remove from hair

My two daughters absolutely love glitter or anything shiny so the Blinger Ultimate Set was a perfect gift for them It is very easy for them to use with younger kids and adult should help read instructions but after that they will get it

My daughter loves this Such a fun gift We have blinged her hair every day since Christmas Easy to remove the gems at the end of the day and they stay nicely in her hair all day too

Perfect gift for my 6 year old granddaughter Im sure she will love it for a few years She blings everything

It was a great deal and my daughter gets so much joy out of using it

I liked using in my hair totally fun on special occasions

Very disappointed in what was advertised and what I received Advertised as receiving in a big box and with 225 jewels Received in a tiny box with about 12 jewels as advertised

I got this for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas as shes been asking ever since shes saw the commercial and it worked out great for her Easy toUse but she did go through the little jewels fast so I do need to purchase more But she loved them and had fun plus great price

I bought this for my niece and she loves it She has the little sparkle pieces in her hair every time I see her

Disappointed in the cheap plastic set I couldve easily bought jewels and stuck them in my hair without this plastic applicator

Bought as a gift for my daughter who loves all things shiny  Shes enjoyed blinging not only her hair but also her clothes and bookshelves

Im nearly 30 and bought this for myself lol I love the bling and it really holds in the hair My only complaint would be I wish each ring came with more bling

Not very tough made and doesnt always work right

It was a fun gift for my niece she used it for a day and got bored with it because the gems fell off moments after being applied

My daughter likes this  It is so easy her dad can use it  It takes a bunch to be obvious in the hair  Easy to remove to  Why not give it a shot

Our 5 year old begged for this after seeing it on youtube She already knew how to load it The jewels are just stickers but stick well and dont fall out easy It comes with a good amount of refills too

My daughter asked for this for christmas I was happy with the packaging and product ovverall

There super cute but the product is a bit wonky and gets jammed

Great gift for a little one My niece I got it for is 5 but her older sister who is 7 also loves it

A gift  they were happy

Fun and easy to use

Giving it for Christmas Were very prompt with delivery Also sent another set of sparkles as a gift Very nice So my grand hasnt used it yet but I think she will love it

Purchased for my 9 year old daughter She loved it Already burnt all the jewels it comes with out Used on her tablet hair cloths everything she could find

Neice has been wanting this for a long time I bought it and it doesnt seem to be much to me but she loved it

Birthday girl loved it

Was a hit for my granddaughters I thought I was over priced but they liked it The bling does stay if you click it perfect if not they lose that one

Daughter loved it for her 12th birthday She is into doing hair and this was a perfect touch Went ahead and preordered the nail blinger as well

Granddaugutter loved it Little tricky at first and then got the hang of it Stuck to everything she used it on

Daughter loves them So far weve only used them in her hair They stick much better then I thought they would

My daughter asked for this for her birthday I honestly didnt think it would work well but got it anyways I was wrong its actually really cute and very easy to use Shes 10 and loves it

I gave this to a 6 year old for Christmas It made her squeal in delight

Daughter likes it very much

Bought this as a gift for my granddaughter We could not get them to stick in her hair They did stick onto other items clothes bags ECT

Bought this for an 8 yr olds birthday She absolutely love it

Gave as a gift for 8 year old niece She loved it She has used it in everything

Was a little hard to use  Big sister got it going tho

Looks beautiful in our grand daughters hair Easy to use and looks great

My daughter is 4 yrs old and she loves her gems  she can put them on herself its easy to use and great for kids

Easy to use and set up my girls love putting the bling in their hair

Easy to use and loved by by the younger crowd they can glam up with ease

super cute way to decorate hair and works pretty well gems stick well and think would last long

The box came ripped and dented The gems were no longer attached to the wheels they are suppose to be displayed on The gems had all fallen off and were all in the bottom of the box

My child loved it

I bought this for my 6 year old granddaughter  She loved them

My daughter loved this product easy to use and fun for the kids to entertain themselves

My daughter loves this and it comes with enough for them to use for awhile

Nice

This item is so cute but I wasnt happy with how difficult is was to use the bling got constantly stuck in the machine The bling sticks on well if you can get it to work my 7 year old couldnt use it

Cute idea but the clip inside that turns the gems broke within the first few gems applied I can still use it but I have to turn the wheel with my fingers and the wheel is hard to turn Not put together well at all

My daughter absolutely loved it

This item made my Great Grand Daughter so happy for herBirthday

Amazing

My daughter is so happy with them

This was a Christmas gift for my 7 year old granddaughter and she was so excited Shed wanted it awhile But were  so very disappointedit broke the first time Very upsetting



Hard for children to use Not worth the money

I want to give it to my nieces xmas gift and today when I try to open the package  I found a hair and the box is damaged  Its not a new one  Return it

Product falls out of hair after less than a minute Cheaply made

This item broke after 4 uses The piece into the center of the product popped off and wouldnt pop back on for operation Complete waste of money

I thought this was going to be the actual blinger turned out it was just the replacement kit

It broke the first day Wont recommend

Stickers would not stick to anything

Exactly what it says

Got this kit on Amazon Prime Day my daughter enjoyed decorating her hair with the blinger and I am very happy with the deal  Definitely will recommend this

Super fun an easy to put brings on anything  Very cool item for any girl

Bought this for my granddaughter The little sticky jewels will not stick to hair let alone much else I am disappointed in the product and regret purchasing it

This was a gift for a 9yearold family member She had a great deal of fun playing with it and glamorizing everyones hair including the menThe men were good sports but were fairly quick to remove them after a bit I even had a couple placed in my hair and it hurt a tiny bit when it was removed as I have a lot of hairbut it left no residue to clean up which is goodHer little sister may be getting that next year  if someone takes the hint lol

My 9 year old granddaughter got this for Christmas  She was delighted and had asked for it She blings anything that stands still long enough to get a sparkle  She has decorated my sweater purse and her cats collar  Im sure I will be buying refills for it soon It is easy to use and fun for her to decorate things with  They are easy to remove and relocate

I bought this for my 7 year old great granddaughter and she and her best friend love it I hear their giggles as they glam up

It is like a bedazzle like from back in time My daughter loves putting them in her hair on on clothes and really on anything that she can think of they stick in the hair the best

Worked like a charm for my grandaughters birthday gift She is having a blast using itBig smiles all around

Perfect and easy to use for a 7 and 5 year old great combo of jewels too

Its a great tool to bedazzle your hair Moms and Grandmas too

I thought this was gonna be super dumb but my daughter loves it

Eight year old Granddaughter loved it She even blinged the dog

Love this

Very easy to use The gems stayed on all night long and until the morning They are easy to take off just brush them off or pick them off

Fast shipping thanks

Gift for my niece

My daughter loves it

Got this for my daughter and she is OBSESSED Its so easy to use and so perfect for occasions

My 5yr old loves this She isnt disappointed one bit She has blinged everything including the dog

It not as easy to use as seen on camera also when my daughter finally gets it in her hair it fall out all over the house

Granddaughter loves it

Fairly easy to use and granddaughters fought over it The little pieces ended up on the floor and kept us busy cleaning them up but worth it

This item is horrible Doesnt work as described Blinker cant staple gems in to the hair

All my granddaughters loved this ages 6 8 10  The jewels stick nice but super easy to come off with no damage to surface  Super easy to use

Perfect gift for my 7 year old niece

Ive always wanted these when I was younger and now that Im older Im so happy I can buy these for myself They could also be a perfect gift for someone in your life Very easy to use and great value for the money

they love it

Me hubiera gustado que trajera ms repuestos trae muy pocos

Lo compr para mi adulta con cabello largo y grueso y creo que funciona mejor para infantes pero an as est cool

My daughter has had the gems in for multiple days in a row lasting through swimming in our pool and a day at the lake She put some on our dog and 3 days later theyre still on  Theyre easy to take out without pulling the hair and can sometimes be reused Very easy for 6 year old to use  Will be buying more for birthday gifts for her friends

Too expensive

La verdad es que es justo como lo esperaba lo us para un festival musical en el que cant grit bail y sud por horas incluso despus me amarr el cabello y los brillitos seguan en su lugar

Everyone except the dog loved this he doesnt like the clicking noise  extremely easy to use and lots of fun The stickers have great staying power and look very cute The 8 year old birthday girl her friends and even the adults had so much fun bejewelling our hair and sparkling all night It works perfectly

Esta divertido pero las piedras se caen con mucha facilidad no necesitas tocarlas para q se caigan porque caen por s solas y a pesar de q tengo prime tuve problemas con el envo x parte del vendedor aunque Amazon me resolvi rpido

No se parece nada en la publicacin se ve una caja grande y de muy buena calidadPero ya en vivo se ve muy distintoNada que ver con lo publicado

This product didnt come in a big box like shown does not have the number of gems that it says it had I now have to buy more elsewhere Not happy that it wasnt as shown

Lleg antes de lo programado y le gusto a mi hija recomiendo al vendedor

Le encant a mi hija

Excelente regalo de navidad

Its a gifted for my niece I am hoping she will love it as for she did want one really bad so I guess I will see on Christmas Day
