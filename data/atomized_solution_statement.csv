Problem Statement,Solution
Text,"This problem statement cannot be solved using TRIZ as it is a product description and not a technical problem. TRIZ is a methodology used to solve technical problems and invent new products, processes or systems."
Low Quality and Durability,"The problem stated in the problem statement is low quality and durability. To solve this problem using TRIZ, we need to first understand the problem in detail.

According to the given problem statement, the Blinger Ultimate Set, Glam Collection, is a hair and fashion accessory kit. The set includes a Glam Styling Tool and 225 gems in various shapes and colors. The Glam Styling Tool is a handheld device that you load with gems and click to apply them to your hair or clothing. The gems are made with high-quality materials that are durable and long-lasting. However, it has been observed that the quality and durability of the product is low.

To solve the problem of low quality and durability, we can use the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix. The Contradiction Matrix helps in finding a solution to a problem by providing a list of possible solutions based on principles of TRIZ.

The main contradiction in this problem is between the requirement for high-quality and durable product and the requirement for a device that allows you to load and click gems easily. To solve this contradiction, we can use the following principles from the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix:

Principle 2: Taking out / Removing. We can remove the need for a device to load and click the gems by using a different mechanism to apply the gems. For example, we can use a spray mechanism to apply the gems instead of the click mechanism. This will eliminate the need for a device and will result in a higher quality and durable product.

Principle 21: Skipping. We can skip the requirement for a device altogether. Instead of a device, we can provide a pre-designed sticker sheet that already has the gems arranged in different shapes and colors. This will eliminate the need for a device and will result in a higher quality and durable product.

Principle 31: Porous Materials. We can use porous materials for making the device and the gems. This will make the device and the gems more breathable and durable, resulting in a higher quality and durable product.

Principle 38: Strong Oxidants. We can use strong oxidants to make the device and the gems more resistant to wear and tear. For example, we can use a material like diamond or graphene for the device and the gems. This will result in a higher quality and durable product.

Based on the above principles, we can come up with the following solutions to solve the problem of low quality and durability of the Blinger Ultimate Set, Glam Collection:

1. Redesign the device to use a spray mechanism to apply the gems instead of the click mechanism. This will eliminate the need for a device and will result in a higher quality and durable product.

2. Provide a pre-designed sticker sheet that already has the gems arranged in different shapes and colors. This will eliminate the need for a device and will result in a higher quality and durable product.

3. Use porous materials for making the device and the gems. This will make the device and the gems more breathable and durable, resulting in a higher quality and durable product.

4. Use strong oxidants to make the device and the gems more resistant to wear and tear. For example, we can use a material like diamond or graphene for the device and the gems. This will result in a higher quality and durable product.

These solutions can be further evaluated and improved using TRIZ techniques to come up with the best possible solution for the problem."
Lack of Adhesiveness,"The problem statement mentioned is ""Lack of Adhesiveness"". This could mean that the gems included in the Blinger Ultimate Set may not stick properly to the hair or clothing. In order to solve this problem using TRIZ, we can start by analyzing the system and identifying any contradictions or harmful effects.

Contradiction: The gems should stick to the hair or clothing, but they are not sticking.

Harmful Effect: The gems may fall off, causing inconvenience to the user and possibly damaging the user's hair or clothing.

To resolve the contradiction and overcome the harmful effect, we can use the following TRIZ principles:

1. Principle of Segmentation: Divide an object into parts that can perform separate, independent functions.

We can use this principle by creating a two-layered adhesive system. The top layer could have weaker adhesive properties and hold the gem in place, while the bottom layer could have stronger adhesive properties and securely attach the gem to the hair or clothing.

2. Principle of Merging: Combine two parts or objects to perform a new or additional function.

We can use this principle by integrating the adhesive system into the gem itself. This can be done by using a special type of glue that is already present on the back of the gem. When pressed onto the hair or clothing, the gem's own adhesive would activate and attach itself securely.

3. Principle of Inert Atmosphere: Replace a normal environment with an inert one (e.g. vacuum, nitrogen) where harmful or unwanted reactions can't occur.

We can use this principle by encapsulating the gem in a material that prevents oxygen from reacting with the adhesive. This will reduce the chance of the adhesive losing its stickiness over time, ensuring that the gem remains attached for longer periods.

By applying the above TRIZ principles, we can improve the adhesiveness of the gems in the Blinger Ultimate Set, making it more efficient and reliable for the users."
Shortage of Gems and Refills,This problem statement is not suitable for a TRIZ analysis as it does not involve any technical problem or contradiction. It is mostly a supply chain and inventory management issue. The best course of action would be to increase production capacity or to optimize the supply chain to ensure the availability of the product on the market. Another solution would be to find alternative sources of gems and refills or to develop new materials that could be used as a substitute.
High Price,"The problem statement does not provide any issue to solve. It only provides a product description. Therefore, there is no need to apply TRIZ to solve this problem."
